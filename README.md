# ZSED - Zero Shot Embedding Detection for Object Detection

## Overview

ZSED is a project focused on implementing zero-shot embedding for object detection. The primary aim is to enhance object detection models, enabling them to identify and categorize objects not encountered during their training phase. This is accomplished through the application of advanced embedding techniques.

## Features

- Zero-shot object detection
- Embedding-based classification
- Compatibility with popular object detection frameworks

## Installation

To install and use ZSED, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alaaeldinn/ZSED.git
   ```
